C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia).

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
for learning OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.
Since C++ is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
follow the C++98 standard.
